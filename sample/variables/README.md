# Pynini Variables sample

A basic pynini sample showing use of variables.

The files ``index.html`` and ``index.yml`` show trivial use of substitution variables.

The files ``staff.html`` and ``staff.yml`` show how to use iteration to display a staff list.

The files ``products/index.html`` and ``products/index.yml`` show both iteration and
generation of pages.
